			<h2>Forum & Feedback</h2>
			<p>Here our community can express itself , exchange opinions and interact about whatever they want*.
				<br>
			</p>
			<p><br><br>This forum is intended to give you an opportunity to air your views on whatever tattoo related topics take your fancy. It is open to all (enthusiasts, artists, those who have not yet 'dabbled' but intend doing so, and even those who dislike all things tattoo related but would like to have their ha'pence worth anyway!). It is a means by which those who are interested can participate further in the research, providing more personal and in-depth opinions, which is not possible when filling out the survey.

				At present, there is only one discussion forum active (Somaesthetics Chat) which will incorporate as many topics as you wish to create. In the future other forums may be created in order to group thematically related topics under more relavant forums.
				
				When you enter the forum you will see a topic summary, showing the author who created each topic, the topic title, how many hits (replies) it's had, and the time (if it's within the last 24 hrs) or date (if older) of the latest one. If you'd like to view the details of any of these discussion topics, simply click on the topic title which will take you to a comment summary for that particular topic, showing authors, comments and dates (latest first). You can hit the 'Reply' button here which will take you to a page where you can participate in this topic by entering your name or nickname, and whatever it is you have to say. Hit 'Send' and you'll be taken back to the comment summary which will show your comment at the top. You can also start a new discussion topic from the topic summary page. Just click on the 'Start New Topic' button which will take you to page requesting your name or nickname, a short topic title and the initial comment you'd like to make to kick things off. If you've got any questions to pose, or comments to make outside of this forum, why not Contact Me separately by email.
				
				Don't forget to check the forum again soon for new comments and replies to those topics which you've participated in, and also for new topics.
